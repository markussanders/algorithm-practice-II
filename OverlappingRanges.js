// Determine overlapping numbers in ranges.

//You will be given an array with 5 numbers. The first 2 numbers represent a range, and the next two numbers represent another range. 
//The final number in the array is X. The goal of your program is to determine if both ranges overlap by at least X numbers. 
//For example, in the array [4, 10, 2, 6, 3] the ranges 4 to 10 and 2 to 6 overlap by at least 3 numbers (4, 5, 6),
// so your program should return true.
